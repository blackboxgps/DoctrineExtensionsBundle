This bundle provides integration for
[DoctrineExtensions](http://github.com/l3pp4rd/DoctrineExtensions) in
your Symfony2 Project. Forked from stof/StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle to add some of the missing extensions that are needed for our own projects. 

For documentation, see:

> Note:
>
> The master branch of the bundle is in sync with Symfony master branch which
> contains a BC break. If you are using a 2.0.x version of Symfony, you need
> to use the 1.0.x branch of the bundle.
